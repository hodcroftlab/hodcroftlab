## New Opportunity to Join Pathoplexus, Loculus & ARTIC 2 as Post-Doc or Software Engineer

Are you excited by the idea of building global infrastructure to make pathogen sequencing more accessible, interpretable, and equitable? The [Epidemiology and Virus Evolution (EVE) Group](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/about/mpi/epidemiology-and-viral-evolution) at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) is offering a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of world-leading efforts:

- [ARTIC 2](https://artic.network/) the latest evolution of the renowned ARTIC project, enabling affordable, portable, and real-time genetic sequencing & surveillance
- [Pathoplexus](https://pathoplexus.org/) a pioneering open-source platform redefining how viral sequence data is shared and governed globally, powered by the modular backend database software [Loculus](https://loculus.org/)

This is a chance to be part of an international team making a very real, tangible impact on global health and data equity!

Some key aims of the position:
- Design and deployment of privacy-conscious, locally-hosted genomic data infrastructures using Loculus
- Extending Loculus to link seamlessly with the ARTIC 2 sequencing pipeline for local storage, as well as enabling easy ‘one-button’ upload of viral sequence data to Pathoplexus
- Integration of viral and bacterial analytical pipelines into Cephalopod, the offline research engine of ARTIC 2

We're offering 1 position in two different forms to find the perfect candidate:
- A post-doctoral position for those on an academic track, with support for traditional academic outputs and career advancement: https://jobs.swisstph.ch/Vacancies/1087/Description/2
- A software engineer position for those without a PhD, with support for learning about biological data & skill-building: https://jobs.swisstph.ch/Vacancies/1082/Description/2

Please see the job listings above for full descriptions and requirements! 
oth positions require a strong coding background (though more experience is expected for the software developer position). Please apply once for the position best suited to you.
