Anna “Anya” Parker is a scientific software engineer in the EVE group at the [Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/) in Basel. She is a member of the [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/) and part of the [Pathogen Data Network](https://pathogendatanetwork.org/). In her role at the EVE group, she builds scalable tools for pathogen genomics, data storage, and data analysis. She is a co-developer of [Loculus](https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus) — a database and query engine for large-scale pathogen sequencing data — and a maintainer of [Pathoplexus](https://pathoplexus.org/), an open-source database for viral pathogens. With a background in mathematics and computational biology, Anya is  motivated by the application of quantitative methods to public health, and she is enthusiastic about building open-source tools that support public health labs, outbreak response teams, and researchers around the world.

Anya’s career path spans several areas of applied mathematics and software engineering. During university she worked in [theoretical cryptology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13502) at the [Cryptology and Data Security Group](https://crypto.unibe.ch/), she later interned at [SONOVA](https://www.sonova.com/de) with a focus on digital signal processing, and worked as a software engineer in [Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/) at Google Zurich — experiences that gave her a broad and flexible foundation for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. She brings an interdisciplinary, systems-oriented mindset, paired with a naturally energetic and proactive approach to tackling new challenges.

Before joining Swiss TPH, Anya worked in the [cEVO group](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo) at ETH Zurich as a scientific software developer, contributing to Loculus, [Genspectrum](https://genspectrum.org/), [LAPIS](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS) and [LAPIS-SILO](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO). She also spent a year in the [Neher Lab](https://neherlab.org/) at the Biozentrum Basel, contributing to [TreeTime](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime), [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/), and [TreeKnit](https://github.com/PierreBarrat/TreeKnit.jl) — tools that infer phylogenies and ancestral reassortment graphs used widely in global pathogen surveillance. During her time at Google Zurich, she helped maintain and monitor critical infrastructure systems, strengthening her focus on reliability, performance, and clean engineering practices.

Across teams, Anya is known for her curiosity, creativity, and infectious enthusiasm. She thrives at the intersection of software engineering and scientific discovery, where clean architecture meets complex biological questions. Outside of work, she plays drums, bullet journals, watches hours of lectures on how to build robots that she never seems to get to building and experiments with protein modeling and structural AI — finding joy in learning, collaboration, and the occasional perfectly timed backbeat.
