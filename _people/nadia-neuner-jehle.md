Nadia Neuner-Jehle is a PhD student in the EVE group at the [Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/) in Basel, where she studies the evolution and spread of non-polio enteroviruses. With a background in biomedical sciences and a sharp eye for detail — from viral phylogenies to perfectly organized Notion pages — Nadia is driven by curiosity about how viruses change, move through populations, and evade immunity.

Before starting her PhD, Nadia worked on HIV molecular epidemiology with [Roger Kouyos](https://www.usz.ch/en/department/infectiology/research/research-group-roger-kouyos/) at the University Hospital Zurich, where she investigated the interplay between viral evolution, host immune response (particularly HLA types), and time since infection. This work sparked her deeper interest in how viruses adapt under immune pressure — a thread that continues in her current focus on enteroviruses like EV-D68, EV-A71, and more.

Her research investigates viral recombination, antigenic evolution, and the complex dynamics that shape outbreaks. Using tools like [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/), [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/) and custom bioinformatics pipelines, she builds datasets and analyses that help trace how these pathogens evolve and circulate over time and space. Nadia’s approach blends rigorous computational work with a strong interest in open science, reproducibility, and collaborative research.

Originally from Switzerland, Nadia brings not only scientific precision but also warmth and creativity to the EVE group. She enjoys finding clarity in complex problems and building systems that make research more efficient and reproducible. Outside of work, she finds balance in the outdoors — hiking in the mountains and appreciating nature in all seasons — or indoors with a cup of coffee, a good book, or a board game night with friends. She believes research should be both impactful and enjoyable — and that thoughtful, well-annotated code is a small form of art.
