"Global Genomics, Local Impact"

[ARTIC 2](https://artic.network/) builds on the success of the original ARTIC project, which helped revolutionize how we respond to viral outbreaks with real-time genomic data. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ARTIC’s open-source sequencing protocols were used worldwide to track the virus, enabling the rapid identification of variants like Alpha. With ARTIC 2, we’re expanding this toolkit to support a broader range of viruses and bacteria, with a strong focus on tools that are affordable, portable, and practical for use in low-resource settings.

The project develops three levels of sequencing strategies - targeted, panel-based, and metagenomic - along with the software, reagents, and training needed to make them work anywhere, from national labs to field sites. We’re aiming to launch an analysis and planning platform that helps public health teams design and interpret genomic investigations using local data. By partnering closely with institutes in Africa and working to open up reagent and equipment access, ARTIC 2 aims to build lasting, equitable capacity for genomic surveillance worldwide.

As part of this collaboration, EVE lab is bringing together [Pathoplexus/Loculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/collaborations/pathoplexus/) and ARTIC 2, to enable better sequence storage and sharing. By integrating into the ARTIC 2 sequencing software, users will be able to use a Loculus instance to store data locally, and in time upload this directly to Pathoplexus (with time-limited use restrictions, if desired) to enable global sharing.
