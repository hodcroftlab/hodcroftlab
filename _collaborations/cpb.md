[The Centre for Pathogen Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/centre-for-pathogen-bioinformatics) (CPB) is a multi-site initiative led by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), established in late 2024 to consolidate Switzerland's computational expertise in pathogen surveillance and molecular data analysis. Positioned at the intersection of public health and research, CPB offers advanced services in pathogen bioinformatics - such as data hosting, processing, genomic epidemiology, and expert consultancy - to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and global partners.

CPB builds on proven COVID‑19 tools like [SPSP](https://spsp.ch/), [V‑pipe](https://cbg-ethz.github.io/V-pipe/), [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/), [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/), [CoVariants](https://covariants.org/), [CoVSpectrum](https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Switzerland/AllSamples/Past6M), and [Loculus]({{ "/collaborations/pathoplexus/" | relative_url }}) to drive real‑time pathogen surveillance and ensure Switzerland remains at the forefront of molecular surveillance infrastructure. Governance is provided by a steering board including key players such as Aitana Neves (Managing Director), Niko Beerenwinkel, Emma Hodcroft, Richard Neher, and Tanja Stadler, who guide strategy and international alignment toward FAIR data sharing through initiatives like the Pathogen Data Network.
