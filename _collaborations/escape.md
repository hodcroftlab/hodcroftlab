[ESCAPE](https://www.escapepandemics.com/) (Efficient and rapidly SCAlable EU‑wide evidence‑driven Pandemic response plans through dynamic Epidemic data assimilation) is a Horizon Europe‑funded interdisciplinary research initiative running from January 2023 to December 2026.

Its core objective is to develop a science‑based blueprint for faster, more coordinated pandemic preparedness—especially for hypothetical "pathogen X" - by leveraging real‑time data, standardized protocols, and analytical tools. ESCAPE focuses on improving data readiness, modelling and decision aid frameworks, identifying factors driving successful response strategies, and building a multi‑stakeholder knowledge network involving policymakers, scientists, the media, and the public.

By synthesizing lessons from COVID‑19, the project aims to deliver evidence‑based guidelines and digital decision support tools to reduce societal and economic impact in future pandemics, reinforce public trust, and facilitate more effective, harmonized responses across Europe.

Dr. Emma Hodcroft & EVE contribute to ESCAPE as a team member, focusing on genomic epidemiology and data integration. She is particularly involved in aiming to to improve statistical methods for estimating key epidemic parameters (e.g., growth rates, reproduction numbers, severity) and correct for biases in early outbreak data. In addition, she's dedicated to developing better methods of integrating novel data types (in particular, linking immunological and sequencing data with modelling in [HCoVs]({{ "/projects/hcovs/" | relative_url }}) and [EVs]({{ "/projects/evs/" | relative_url }}) ), and creating more equitable, easier ways to share data quickly in outbreak and pandemic scenarios (linked with [Pathoplexus]({{ "/collaborations/pathoplexus/" | relative_url }})).
