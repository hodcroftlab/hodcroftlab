The [Viral Immunology (VIM) group](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/about/mpi/viral-immunology) at the Swiss TPH, led by [Dr. Katharina RÃ¶ltgen](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/staff/profile/people/katharina-roeltgen), focuses on understanding immune responses to viral infections with an emphasis on public health relevance. Their research explores how both innate and adaptive immune systems respond to viral pathogens, aiming to inform vaccine design, diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches. The group applies a broad range of techniques including serological assays, molecular diagnostics, and immunological profiling to investigate how different viruses interact with the human immune system. Current projects span various viruses of global concern, with particular attention to populations in low- and middle-income countries, where viral disease burdens and immune landscapes can differ significantly from those in high-income settings.

EVE group collaborates closely with VIM on several interdisciplinary projects that combine epidemiological insights with immunological analyses. One of the key areas of joint research is a longitudinal study in Ghana, focusing on the epidemiology and genomic diversity of Coronaviruses and Enteroviruses. Together, the teams aim to understand how these viruses circulate in African populations and how immune responses shape and are shaped by viral diversity.

Current collaborative efforts include co-supervised MSc and PhD projects that investigate active infections and past exposures through both molecular and serological techniques. These projects use cutting-edge genomic tools, such as sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, alongside antibody profiling to explore virus evolution and immunity over time. The partnership between EVE and VIM enriches the research by combining strengths in virus genomics with in-depth immunological expertise, contributing to a holistic view of virus-host dynamics in diverse settings. 

We hope and plan to expand this work even further in the future!
