Loculus is a software package to power microbial genomic databases. It is used by [Pathoplexus](https://pathoplexus.org/).

Major features include:
- Upload and storage of consensus sequences and metadata using a simple web interface or a web API
- Flexible data preprocessing: Loculus comes with a [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/)-based preprocessing that is able to align and translate sequences but it is also easy to implement and plug-in your own pipeline.
- Powerful searches: Loculus provides a user-friendly interface to search and view sequences as well as an API to query the data.
- Highly configurable: The list of metadata fields is fully configurable and Loculus supports both single- and multi-segmented genomes.
