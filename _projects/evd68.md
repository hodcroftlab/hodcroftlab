Our research on Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) focuses on untangling its complex evolutionary patterns and improving tools for surveillance and classification. A key priority is refining clade nomenclature, to bring greater clarity and consistency to how EV-D68 lineages are identified and tracked over time. We are also working to improve the annotation of genomic regions, particularly across the VP3–VP1 junction. These efforts feed directly into platforms like Nextclade and Nextstrain, enabling more reliable monitoring of EV-D68 evolution in near real-time. In addition, we're interested in using immunological data and models to better understand immunity against EV-D68 and the role adult reinfection may play in circulation and evolutionary pressure on the virus.

We are collaborating with Prof. Katharina Röltgen’s [VIM group]({{ "/collaborations/vim/" | relative_url }}) to better understand EV-D68 circulation in under-sampled regions. Together, we are testing nasopharyngeal swabs collected in Africa to assess the presence and diversity of EV-D68 in acute cases. In parallel, we are using serological and immunological assays to investigate past exposure, aiming to uncover population-level immunity and its relationship to virus evolution. These combined efforts offer a deeper, more integrated picture of EV-D68’s global dynamics and its public health implications.
